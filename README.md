# Password-Strength-and-Attacks-
This project focuses on creating, testing, and evaluating passwords to understand what makes a password strong or weak. It also explains how attackers commonly break passwords and why password complexity matters.

Overview

This task includes:

Creating multiple passwords with different levels of complexity

Checking password strength using online tools

Learning best practices for secure passwords

Understanding how password complexity improves safety

Identifying common password attack techniques

Tested Passwords and Strength

Riya@2003 - Weak (1 hour to crack)
Riya963852741 - Strong (1 month to crack)
Riya@0336 - Medium (5 days to crack)
123456789 - Very Weak (13 seconds to crack)
Riya@9693725405 - Very Strong (1000 years to crack)

Best Practices for Strong Passwords

Use 12 to 16 characters or more

Mix uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters

Avoid personal info like names and birth dates

Do not reuse old passwords

Use passphrases like GreenTiger@Sky21

Use a password manager to store and generate passwords

Important Tips Learned

Longer passwords are harder to crack

Adding just one symbol can make a big difference

Avoid common patterns and dictionary words

Random passwords are more secure

Common Types of Password Attacks

Brute Force – Tries all possible combinations until the password is found
Dictionary Attack – Uses lists of common passwords or words
Phishing – Tricks users into entering their password on a fake site

Why Complexity Matters

A strong password protects your data. Using a mix of characters and making your password longer reduces the chances of it being cracked. Simple passwords like 123456 are guessed in seconds. Strong ones like R!ya@9693725405 may take centuries.
